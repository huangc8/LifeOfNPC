2 - F: “You’re certainly more energetic than before.”  
2 - S: “Should I not be?.”  
2 - F: “It’s actually really creepy.” 
2 - S: “Sorry about that.  What are you getting this time?”
2 - F: “That’s more like it, Shopkeep.  I need a new sword, a new bow, new armor-.”
2 - S: “And some other stuff, right?”
2 - F: “Right.”
3 - S: “Well Felix, let’s see what I’ve got for you.”

3a1 - F: “Yes.”  
3a1 - S: “That’s what I thought you’d sa- Wait, did you say yes?”

3a3a - F: “Ugh, just get on with it.”

3c - S: “So how are things going?” 
3c - F: “Hit the 70th floor yesterday.”   
3c - S: “The 70th floor?  Impressive!”  
3c - F: “It sounds great, but it was a pain in the behind.  You’d think more people would make it easier, but nope!  Just how many traps can one girl set off?”  
3c - S: “Oh?  You’re traveling with a girl?”
3c - F: “It’s nowhere even close to what you’re thinking.” 
3c - S: “Really now?” 
3c - F: “Really now.  I just met up with someone at random while I was exploring the Dungeon; Rielle or something.  What kind of crazy person thanks someone who saved their life by kicking them in the face?” 
3c - S: “She seems like quite the character.”  
3c - F: “Ugh, you have no idea!  She swans in out of nowhere, copies my style, ‘but I’m a wizard too, so it’s completely original, really’, and sets off every trap in the next five floors!  And she has the gall to complain when I tell her about the best course of action!  Honestly, she’s lucky I was around to save her so many times.” 
3c - S: “She’s lucky you were around, huh?  Sounds nice to me.” 
3c - F: “I guess.”
3c - S: “She ever help you at all?” 
3c - F: “Not in the slightest!  Well, there was that one time with the Minotaur Dracolich... But she was the one who got us into that fight anyways!”  
3c - S: “Sounds like you’re having quite a bit of fun in the Dungeon.” 
3c - F: “Ugh, don’t wear that smile on your face.  It’s creepy.  Besides, it’s not like I’m in a permanent party or anything.  I’m just occasionally working with anyone I happen to meet.” 
3c - S: “Still, I’m glad that things are looking up for you, Felix.” 
3c - F: “Yeah, yeah, Shopkeep.  Get back to business.”
4a - [Successful transaction] “It’s... Uhh... Thanks, I guess.  Bye Shopkeep.”  
4b - [Failed transaction] “I guess I’ll just have to go without, then, Shopkeeper.  Bye.”
