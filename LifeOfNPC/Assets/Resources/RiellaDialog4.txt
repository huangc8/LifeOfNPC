2 - R: “All three!”  
2 - S: “All three?”  
2 - R: “All three!  I’ve been having all sorts of trouble because I wasn’t able to damage some enemies with one class, so that’s when I thought ‘Why don’t I just be all of them!’  So give me everything you’ve got, Shopkeeper!  I’m going to be very busy soon, and I’ll need everything I can use!”

3c - S: “And what was that?”  
3c - R: “Being a bard!  All I had to do was spend a couple of hours a day practicing the lute, and I was able to pick up archery and swordfighting in no time!”  
3c - S: “Huh.  Funny how the world works sometimes.”
3c - R: “And I wouldn’t have it any other way!  My parents even stopped complaining once I showed them how strong I was!”
