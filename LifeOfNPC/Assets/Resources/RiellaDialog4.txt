1020000-24: “Shopkeeper, hello!”  
1030000-24: “Riella, welcome!  What are you in the mood for?  Bows?  Swords?  Staffs?”  
1040000-24: “All three!”  
1050000-24: “All three?”  
1060000-24: “All three!  I’ve been having all sorts of trouble because I wasn’t able to damage some enemies with one class, so that’s when I thought ‘Why don’t I just be all of them!’  So give me everything you’ve got, Shopkeeper!  I’m going to be very busy soon, and I’ll need everything I can use!”
2080700-24: “Well, let’s see what we have for you!” 
1130000-24: “I can accept that, Shopkeeper.”
2100900-24: “This time I’m the one who can’t accept the price, Shopkeeper.  $ is my offer.”
1130000-24: “They look good to me.” 
2111200-24: “This time I’m the one who can’t accept the price, Shopkeeper.  $ is my final offer.”
1130000-24: “Very well then.  Here is the payment, Shopkeeper.” 
1130000-24: “How disappointing.  I guess here won’t work out after all...”
1140000-24: “Would you accept $ as payment?”  
1150000-24: “Everything, huh?  I’m amazed; you’re quite talented to pull that off.” 
1160000-24: “Thank you, Shopkeeper!  At first I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to do everything, but then I found a great way to make it all possible!.”   
1170000-24: “And what was that?”  
1180000-24: “Being a bard!  All I had to do was spend a couple of hours a day practicing the lute, and I was able to pick up archery and swordfighting in no time!”  
1190000-24: “Huh.  Funny how the world works sometimes.”
1200000-24: “And I wouldn’t have it any other way!  My parents even stopped complaining once I showed them how strong I was!”  
1210000-24: “That’s great news, Riella!  So, are you enjoying yourself now?” 
1000000-24: “I’ve never had so much fun before in my life!”
