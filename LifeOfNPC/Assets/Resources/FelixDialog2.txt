1 - F: “Oi, Shopkeeper.  You around?”  
1 - S: “Oh, it’s you.  What do you want?”  
2 - F: “My name’s not You; it’s Felix Kyculun.  First Adventurer, and now You?  You must have a really weird taste in names..”  
2 - S: “Alright, Felix.  What do you want?”  
2 - F: “I want you to sell me something, duh.”
2 - S: “What do you want me to sell you, Felix?”
2 - F: “I’m glad you asked!  Get me a better bow and a better sword and some other stuff.”
3 - S: “Well, let’s see what other stuff I have for you.” 
3a1 - S: “I don’t suppose you have any materials you might be willing to sell me?” 
3a1 - F: “Uhh, selling things is your job, Shopkeeper.  Not mine.”  
3b1 - F: “Again with this?  Like I said, I want a better bow, a better sword, and some other useful stuff.”
3b2 - [Player selects which items to offer the customer] 
3b2 - S: “Do [insert items here] work for you?” 
3b3a - F: [Success case] “I guess.  How much?” 
3b3b - F: [Failure case] “Pfft, no.” 
3b4 - [Player sets price of items]
3b4 - S: “[price player sets].”
3b5a - F: [Success case] “Fine.  Here you go, Shopkeeper.”  
3b5b - F: [Failure case] “Like I’d pay that much.”
3b5b - F: “Try [randomly generated price within customer’s thriftiness range].”  
3b6 - [Player sets price of items]
3b6 - S: “[new price player sets].  Take it or leave it.” 
3b7a - F: [Success case] “Tch, fine.  Here’s the money.” 
3b7b - F: [Failure case] “Nope.  Deal’s off.”
3c - S: “How goes the adventuring, Felix?” 
3c - F: “Same as usual; perfectly.”   
3c - S: “Really?  No flaws, no mistakes?”  
3c - F: “Nope.  I’m too good for that.  In all of the times I’ve been in the Dungeon, I’ve never had a challenge.”  
3c - S: “That’s impressive.  I take it you’re not just hanging around the upper levels?”
3c - F: “Pfft, no.  I’ve already cleared floor 30.” 
3c - S: “With your current equipment?  That’s incredible!” 
3c - F: “It was a pain in the behind; killing the monsters took forever!” 
3c - S: “It probably would’ve gone faster if you were in a party.” 
3c - F: “I don’t work in parties.” 
3c - S: “Why, because people don’t like you?  You’re too skilled not for people to want to work with you if you cleared the 30th floor with equipment like that.” 
3c - F: “Because I always win, and I always survive.  Me.  Now can we get back to the buying and the selling?”  
4a - [Successful transaction] “Thanks, Shopkeeper.  This place is a dump, but the items work at least.”  
4b - [Failed transaction] “I knew I shouldn’t have expected anything from this place.”
