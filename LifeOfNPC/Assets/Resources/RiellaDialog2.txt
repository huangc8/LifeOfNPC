1020000-24: “Hello again, Shopkeeper.”  
1030000-24: “Ah, Riella!  How’s life as a wizard treating you?”  
1040000-24: “Hmm... That’s the thing, actually.”  
1050000-24: “Oh?”  
1060000-24: “Things went alright at first, but then I kept running into some problems, and I think I’m going to have to change again.  I want to be a ranger now.”
2080700-24: “Well, let’s see what we have for you!” 
1140000-24: [Success case] “I can accept that, Shopkeeper.”
2100900-24: [Failure case] “This time I’m the one who can’t accept the price, Shopkeeper.  $ is my offer.”
1140000-24: [Success case] “That’s acceptable.  Here is the payment, Shopkeeper.”  
1110000-24: [Failure case] “I’m afraid I can’t pay that much, Shopkeeper.”
2131200-24: “Would you accept $ as payment?”  
1140000-24: [Success case] “Very well then.  Here is the payment, Shopkeeper.” 
1140000-24: [Failure case] “How disappointing.  I’ll have to go to another store...”
1150000-24: “So what went wrong with being a wizard?” 
1160000-24: “Things were fine at first.  I’d shoot a Fireball or a Chain Lightning and the enemies would all die before they even got close to me.  But then I started running into tougher enemies, and some even dodged my spells, and then there were those magic-consuming Slimes, and... I don’t even want to remember it.”   
1170000-24: “I see.  So why do you want to be a ranger now?”  
1180000-24: “With a good bow and some arrows, I’ll be able to shoot clean through those pesky magic-resistant enemies, and I don’t even need to get close to those disgusting Slimes!  I’ll poison them, riddle them with arrows, and laugh as they feebly struggle to their grave!”  
1000000-24: “Well, I hope it works out for you.”
