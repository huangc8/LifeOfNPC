1020000-1:  Once again, greetings Shopkeeper!  The Greatest Adventurer in the World is here to 
1030000-1:  purchase your wares!
1040000-1:  Quartz, good to see you!  How goes things with the party?  Did you have enough potions? 
1050000-1:  Funny you mention that. Things were going extraordinarily easy; too easy, really.
1060000-1:  We got surrounded by a horde of monsters, and if it wasn’t for those potions we’d have 
1070000-1:	been done for.
1080000-1:  I’m glad that my products could be of use!
1090000-1:  And so am I!  However, my last sword quite unfortunately broke while I faced a dragon.  
1100000-1: 	And that is why I am here, Shopkeeper!.  For a weapon!  For restorative items!  
1200000-1:	And you know what?  Surprise me.  If there’s anything else that could be of use to the 
1300000-1:	Greatest Adventurer in the World, I’ll take it!
2080700-1:  Well, let’s see what we have for you!
1100000-1:  Very well then, Shopkeeper.  Let it not be said that the Greatest Adventurer in the 
1200000-1:	World is not generous!
2090700-1:  I’m afraid that won’t do, Shopkeeper.  $ is my offer.
2121000-1:  I’m afraid that won’t do, Shopkeeper.  $ is my final offer.
1110000-1:  A pleasure doing business with you, Shopkeeper!
1120000-1:  I’m afraid that’s that then, Shopkeeper.
2141300-1:  I’m looking for a Lakeborn Sword, if you happen to have one in stock.
2151300-1:	Some Elixirs of Rejuvenation, Unguents of Invigoration, and Tonics of Restoration as 
2161300-1:	well, and anything else you think is useful.
1180000-1:  Such a price is nothing for the Greatest Adventurer in the World! 
1190000-1:	I accept your offer, Shopkeeper!
1150000-1:  That price will not do, Shopkeeper!
2171600-1:  If you must insist, I’ll pay $.
1180000-1:  Very well then, Shopkeeper!  I accept your offer!
1180000-1:  That price will simply not do!  The Greatest Adventurer in the World will have to 
1190000-1:	seek his goods in another store!
1200000-1:  So, how are things with the party?  That paladin still giving you trouble?
1210000-1:  Tarkin?  He’ll still insufferable, and always bragging every time he blocks an attack 
1220000-1:	or parries a blow!  Still, he’s reliable, even if a bit flamboyant.  Kaysel’s still 
1230000-1:	doing all sorts of weird experiments, but he’s actually able to talk to people for more
1240000-1:	than five minutes without giving them some sort of horrible disfigurement!  
1250000-1:  And what about that cleric?  Aurora, was it?
1260000-1:  Her name is Amara, Shopkeeper!  And well, you see... The truth is... we’re married!
1270000-1:  You are?  Congratulations!  How did that happen?
1280000-1:  It started way back when I was thinking about getting a new sword.  My old one gave out
1290000-1:  on me at the worst possible time, and monsters swarmed in. I don’t remember much of 
1300000-1:	what happened next; one moment, three Orcs were about to kill her, the next, I’d torn 
1310000-1:	them all to pieces. There were still far too many of them to face, however, and even
1320000-1:  running away was a challenge. If we hadn’t had enough healing potions, things could have
1330000-1:  gone very badly.  
1340000-1:  So she warmed up to you after that?
1350000-1:  It turns out that she liked me too!  O-Of course, that would only be natural for the 
1360000-1:	Greatest Adventurer in the World.  We got married and things have gone wonderfully 
1370000-1:	ever since.  She’s still a bit of a worrywart, but I humor her anyways.
1380000-1:  I’m glad you’re doing well, Quartz.
1000000-1:  So am I, Shopkeeper.  So am I.
