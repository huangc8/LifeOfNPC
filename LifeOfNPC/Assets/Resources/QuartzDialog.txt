1020000-1:  H-Hello?  Is this the Item and Treasure Emporium?
1030000-2:  That it is, young’un!  What can I do for you?
1040000-3:  Erm, I’m Quar- Wait, let me start over.  I-I’m Quartz Phoenixtail, and one day I’ll be the Greatest Adventurer in the World!
1050000-4:  Alright then... Quartz... What does the Greatest Adventurer in the World want? 
1060000-5:  Well, you see... the truth is... I haven’t actually gone on an adventure yet.  Today’ll be my first day in the Dungeon, but I don’t have a sword.  So that’s where you come in.  I can’t afford anything but a Trusty Sword, though...
1070000-9:  I’d like a Trusty Sword, if you have one.  Maybe some basic healing items too...
2090800-6:  Well, let’s see what we have for you!
1150000-11: Yeah, that’s fine!  What’s the price?
2111000-12: I don’t really want those items...
1150000-14: Alright then.  Here’s your money, Shopkeeper; thanks for the sword!
1120000-15: I can’t pay that much, Shopkeeper...
2141300-16: If it was $, then I could afford it.
1150000-18: Alright then. Here’s your money, Shopkeeper; thanks for the sword!
1150000-19: I can’t pay that much.  I guess I’ll have to go somewhere else...
1210000-20: Quartz, huh?  That’s an interesting name.
1220000-21: It was my mother’s idea, haha.  Dad wanted a more traditional name like Cirrus, Chain, or Hoshi, but Mom wouldn’t hear a word of it.
1230000-22: Well, you certainly won’t be forgotten any time soon.
1240000-23: Mom said something like that herself.  She always wanted people to know who I was.  So that’s why I need to be the Greatest Adventurer in the World - so I can make her proud.
1000000-24: Thanks again, Shopkeeper!  Take heed of this moment!  For this is the birth of the Greatest Adventurer in the World!
