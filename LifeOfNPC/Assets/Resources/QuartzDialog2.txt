1020000-1:  Greetings, Shopkeeper! I'm Quartz Phoenixtail, the Greatest Adventurer in the World!
1030000-2:  Hello again, Quartz!  Still, a bit loud, aren’t you?
1040000-3:  Ahh... Um... Sorry about that, eheheh.
1050000-4:  Hahaha, that’s alright. So what can I do for the Greatest Adventurer in the World?
1060000-5:  I’ve joined with a party, actually!  We’ve cleared the first few levels of the Dungeon,
1070000-6:  and we’re planning on heading even deeper!  That’s why I’m here, actually; they sent me
1080000-7:  to pick up some recovery items, but...
1090000-2:  Something wrong?
1100000-2:  It’s my sword, you know?  This Trusty Sword was really useful for a while, but I want 
1200000-2:  to get something better, something more fitting for the Greatest Adventurer in the
1300000-2:  World! Still, the potions though... I mean, I probably have enough if I skimp a few...
1410000-2:  The list says I need three Elixirs of Minor Rejuvenation, three Unguents of Minor 
1420000-2:  Invigoration and two tonics of Minor Restoration... But I’ve got enough for the 
1430000-2:	Treebirthed Sword and a bit less potions, too... Agh, I can’t decide!  
1440000-2:	What do you recommend, Shopkeeper?
2111000-8:  Well, let’s see what we have for you!
1170000-1:  That’s fine with me, Shopkeeper.  The Greatest Adventurer in the World is magnanimous!
2131200-1:  I won’t accept that, Shopkeeper.  $ is my offer.
1170000-1:  The Greatest Adventurer in the World will accept your offer! You have my thanks.  
1140000-1:  I won’t pay that much for these goods!
2161500-1:  I’ll pay $, if you insist.
1170000-1:  Very well then, Shopkeeper.  This deal is amenable to me.
1170000-1:  I refuse to pay such an amount; I’ll have to seek my business elsewhere!
1180000-1:  You drive a hard bargain, Quartz.
1190000-1:  Well, as the Greatest Adventurer in the World, I can’t afford to be shortchanged!
1200000-1:  A party, huh?  How’s working in a team treating you?
1210000-1:  Excellently, of course!  How could things go badly for the Greatest Adventurer?
1220000-1:  Hahaha!  So, what are the others like? 
1230000-1:  Well, Kaysel’s the wizard of the party.  He’s pretty strange, and he even made my hair 
1240000-1:  glow in the dark with one of his spells!  It was really annoying at first, but it saved
1250000-1:  us all when that idiot Tarkin set off a Curse of Darkness.  Ugh, Tarkin; what a buffoon!
1260000-1:  Always laughing at me when I tell people about how I’m the Greatest Adventurer in the 
1270000-1:  World!  He thinks he’s so impressive with his greatshield, always showing off to Amara- 
1280000-1:  Oh?  Who’s this Amara?
1290000-1:  Ah, umm... She’s the cleric of the party.  She’s the one who sent me here to buy the 
1300000-1:  potions that we needed.  Honestly, she’s such a worrywart sometimes; we’ve been doing 
1310000-1:	great so far, so we really don’t need to get so many potions... It was one time that 
1320000-1:	I got enveloped by slimes!  Still, that’s just one of the things that’s cute about 
1000000-1:	her- Ahh, what are you making me say!  Back to my sword, I mean my potions!
