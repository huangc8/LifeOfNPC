1 - R: “It’s good to see you, Shopkeeper.”  
1 - S: “Good to see you too, Riella.  Enjoying being a ranger?”  
2 - R: “No, unfortunately.”  
2 - S: “What went wrong?”  
2 - R: “There were some enemies that I couldn’t defeat, and some things happened, and now I’m going to become a warrior.”
3 - S: “Well, let’s see what we have for you!” 
3a1 - S: “On another note, do you have any materials you might be willing to sell me?” 
3a1 - R: “I do, Shopkeeper.”  
3a2 - R: “I have [randomly generated items here].  Does [set amount of money within range] sound acceptable?”
3a3a - S: [Player accepts offer] “I’ll accept, Riella.  Thanks for the business!” 
3a3a - R: “It was no trouble at all, Shopkeeper.”
3a3b - S: [Player denies offer] “Sorry Riella, but that’s more than I’m willing to pay.”
3a3b - S: [Player sets new price] “How about [new price here]?”
3a3c - R: [Success case] “I can accept that, Shopkeeper.”
3a3d - R: [Failure case] “This time I’m the one who can’t accept the price, Shopkeeper.  [set amount of money within range] is my final offer.”
3a3e - S: [Player accepts final offer] “Very well then, Riella.”  
3a3e - R: “I’m glad we came to an accord, Shopkeeper.”
3a3f - S: [Player rejects final offer] “That’s still not a price I’m willing to pay, Riella.”  
3a3f - R: “I suppose that will be all then, Shopkeeper.”  
3b1 - R: “Find me items that a warrior would use, please.”
3b2 - [Player selects which items to offer the customer] 
3b2 - S: “Riella, what do you think of [insert items here]?” 
3b3a - R: [Success case] “They look good to me.  What’s the price?”

3b4 - [Player sets price of items]
3b4 - S: “I’ll sell them all to you for [price player sets].”
3b5a - R: [Success case] “That’s acceptable.  Here is the payment, Shopkeeper.”  
3b5b - R: [Failure case] “I’m afraid I can’t pay that much, Shopkeeper.”
3b5b - R: “Would you accept [randomly generated price within customer’s thriftiness range] as payment?”  
3b6 - [Player sets price of items]
3b6 - S: “I see.  In that case, how does [new price player sets] sound?” 
3b7a - R: [Success case] “Very well then.  Here is the payment, Shopkeeper.” 
3b7b - R: [Failure case] “How disappointing.  I’ll have to go to another store...”
3c - S: “What happened to make you change your mind about being a ranger?” 
3c - R: “At first, everything was fine.  I could pick off enemies from the shadows and easily evade their sluggish attacks.  It was wonderful!  I felt like one of those rangers from the far east who use shadow magic and oddly-shaped metal tools!”   
3c - S: “But...?”  
3c - R: “But the Dungeon is a cheat!  Difficulty is one thing, and danger is another!  But what kind of dungeon has monsters completely immune to projectiles!?  That’s not even remotely close to fair; what sadist made that place anyways!?”  
3c - S: “That’s a question all of us ask.”
3c - R: “But it gets even better!” 
3c - S: “Does it now?” 
3c - R: “Indeed!  Did you know that magic gets counted as a projectile as well?  Because I didn’t until then!” 
3c - S: “How very cruel and unusual; classic Dungeon.”
3c - R: “If I hadn’t been saved by a nearby adventurer, I’d have died!  And worst of all, the person who saved me was unbearably smug.  ‘Oh, that wasn’t so hard,’ he says.  ‘You were having trouble with that?’ he says.  The next time I see him I’ll beat him black and blue!”  
3c - S: “I know exactly what you mean.”
4a - [Successful transaction] “Thank you, Shopkeeper!  I’ll definitely beat that dumba- I mean, that Dungeon!”  
4b - [Failed transaction] “My apologies, Shopkeeper.  It seems I’ll need to go somewhere else.”
