1020000-24: “It’s good to see you, Shopkeeper.”  
1030000-24: “Good to see you too, Riella.  Enjoying being a ranger?”  
1040000-24: “No, unfortunately.”  
1050000-24: “What went wrong?”  
1060000-24: “There were some enemies that I couldn’t defeat, and some things happened, and now I’m going to become a warrior.”
2080700-24: “Well, let’s see what we have for you!” 
1140000-24: “I can accept that, Shopkeeper.”
2100900-24: “This time I’m the one who can’t accept the price, Shopkeeper.  $ is my final offer.”
1140000-24: “That’s acceptable.  Here is the payment, Shopkeeper.”  
1110000-24: “I’m afraid I can’t pay that much, Shopkeeper.”
2131200-24: “Would you accept $ as payment?”  
1140000-24: “Very well then.  Here is the payment, Shopkeeper.” 
1140000-24: “How disappointing.  I’ll have to go to another store...”
1150000-24: “What happened to make you change your mind about being a ranger?” 
1160000-24: “At first, everything was fine.  I could pick off enemies from the shadows and easily evade their sluggish attacks.  It was wonderful!  I felt like one of those rangers from the far east who use shadow magic and oddly-shaped metal tools!”   
1170000-24: “But...?”  
1180000-24: “But the Dungeon is a cheat!  Difficulty is one thing, and danger is another!  But what kind of dungeon has monsters completely immune to projectiles!?  That’s not even remotely close to fair; what sadist made that place anyways!?”  
1190000-24: “That’s a question all of us ask.”
1200000-24: “But it gets even better!” 
1210000-24: “Does it now?” 
1220000-24: “Indeed!  Did you know that magic gets counted as a projectile as well?  Because I didn’t until then!” 
1230000-24: “How very cruel and unusual; classic Dungeon.”
1240000-24: “If I hadn’t been saved by a nearby adventurer, I’d have died!  And worst of all, the person who saved me was unbearably smug.  ‘Oh, that wasn’t so hard,’ he says.  ‘You were having trouble with that?’ he says.  The next time I see him I’ll beat him black and blue!”  
1000000-24: “I know exactly what you mean.”
